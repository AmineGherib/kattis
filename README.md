Kattis Problems
============
URL: https://open.kattis.com

Kattis is an automated testing tool developed at KTH used for course exercises and competitive programming. It is somewhat similar to projects such as "Project Euler" but more focused towards algorithm implementation. Sometimes I solve exercises for fun. Note that there is never any certainty that solutions posted here are correct.
